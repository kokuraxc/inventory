# Inventory App

This is one of the four apps in the **Smart Manufacturing Business Apps (S.M.B.A)** project. 

This app will be used to manage and track the items in the depository. It can also be integrated with the **CRM & Sales App**. In this case, it will check whether there are enough number of required components in store, and send notifications if not when a *purchase order* is placed for certain products.
